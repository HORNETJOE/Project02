the process of implementing the algroithm that would check with the next number to apper is higher or lower based on the users guess was a challenge but was achivable.
##  Description of IDE used and features it proveded
the IDE that was used was a website called Repl.it and it allowed me to write the program in the language i wanted and becuase it was located on a website i was able to access it anywhere that had internet  conection.
## Debugging process and debugging facilities in your chosen IDE
the debugging process and debugging faciities in my chosen IDE helped when finding errors in the program and helped correct some minor mistakes made during the making of the program.
## Outlining Coding standards used with justification
Coding standards and needed when coding becuase it makes the code more understandable for other users looking a the code or just updates and matinance of the code for the original creator. These standards can be shown through commrnts made on the code talking about what does what.
## Evaluation: How debugging process helped
the debugging process helped with fixing the code becuase it allowed me to see the errors in the code and correct them to keep the code working.
